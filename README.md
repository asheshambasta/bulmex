Bulma is a pure CSS framework. Because of that it can be easily used with reflex.
This library realizes that combination.
Bulma already provided styling for a [modal](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/modal/),
we just [implemented](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bulmex/docs/Reflex-Bulmex-Modal.html) 
it for you!
There are also some helper functions for common tasks.
such as making server side rendering easier.
Which is described in a related
[blogpost](https://jappieklooster.nl/reflex-server-side-html-rendering.html).
